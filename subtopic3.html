<td>Abstract</td>
<td>This article explains the process of image compression, which reduces the file size of digital images for storage purposes. There are two main types of compression: lossy and lossless. Lossless compression retains all original data, but it is a huge file size, an example would be PNG. Lossy compression removes some data, resulting in a smaller file size, an example of which would be a JPEG. The article explains the importance of image compression in improving web performance and user experience on multiple platforms. Overall, image compression is very important for making sure that online content is easily available to all devices and users.

<td>Abstract</td>
<td>This article explains how images are stored in a computer, specifically how pixels are stored via the binary numeral system. The article also explains color and how they are stored and seen, including color models like RGB and CMYK, which describe how colors are created and displayed in an image. The article teaches about the two main types of image formats: raster and vector. Raster images consist of a grid of pixels, meaning they lose quality when they are  resized. Vector images are made up of mathematical equations, allowing them to be resized without the loss of quality. Overall, the process in which images are stored on a computer is very important for photographers to understand.
