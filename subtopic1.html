<td>Abstract</td>
<td>Canon Europe explains the role of image sensors in taking photographs. It highlights the two types of sensors: CCD and CMOS. CCD sensors offer high-quality images with low noise but consume more power, making them suitable for professional applications. CMOS sensors, on the other hand, are more power-efficient, allowing for faster processing, though they historically had lower image quality. The article also discusses the advancements in sensor technology, including increased resolution, dynamic range, and low-light performances. Overall, the article explains the importance of image sensors in modern photography, showcasing how they continue to evolve to meet the demands of both amateur and professional photographers.
