<td>Abstract</td>
<td>The article summarizes the history of digital cameras from the idea to the most recent cameras. They begin with the early developments in the 1960s, then to the first digital camera created by Kodak in 1975, which captured images on a cassette tape. The 1990s was a turning point with the introduction of consumer digital cameras, making photography more widely accessible to amateurs. It explains the impact of the technological advancements over the years, including improved image sensors and the rise of smartphones. Overall, the article gives context to how the digital camera has shaped our society to share and capture images.</td>

<td>Abstract</td>
<td>The article highlights the revolutionary work of engineer Steven Sasson, who created a prototype digital camera that captured images using a charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor. The camera weighed around seven pounds and captured black-and-white images onto a cassette tape and took 23 seconds to capture its first image. It could also display the images on a computer monitor. The article explains Sasson's many challenges, including rejection from Kodak because they did not know how to market the digital camera. They also explain how Sasson continued to work in the camera technology industry and later in the 1990s, he helped invent one of the first commercially available digital cameras for Nikon.
